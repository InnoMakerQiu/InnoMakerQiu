## 👋 Hi, I'm Zhiying Qiu

🎓 Undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering (Embedded Systems) at **UESTC**, ranked 6th out of 109 students **(Top 5%)**.

I’m passionate about building **general-purpose robots** by integrating **embodied world models** with embedded systems. My long-term goal is to push the boundary of embodied intelligence on edge devices.

If you find synergy in our interests, feel free to reach out!
