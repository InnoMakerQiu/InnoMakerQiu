## 👋 Hi, I'm Zhiying Qiu

🎓 Undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering (Embedded Systems) at **UESTC**, ranked 6th out of 109 students **(Top 5%)**.

I’m passionate about building **general-purpose robots** by integrating **embodied world models** with embedded systems. My long-term goal is to push the boundary of embodied intelligence on edge devices.

If you find synergy in our interests, feel free to reach out!

<h3 align="left">RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h3>

🚀 **Fast and Stable Diffusion Planning through Variational Adaptive Weighting**  

*Westlake University, with Prof. Tao Lin*  
Improved training efficiency of diffusion-based motion planners; SOTA results with 4k steps. First-author manuscript under revision for ICLR.（More technical details available in [./Application.pdf](./Application.pdf))

🧪 **Fine-Tuning Foundation Models: A Systematic Study**  

Benchmarked 8+ LoRA variants on GLUE/SQuAD; produced internal reports for lab standardization.

🚁 **STM32-Based Quadcopter System**  

Built attitude control system on STM32 using uCOSII; integrated sensor modules for flight stability.
